<!-- This file has been modified for Oracle Java SE extension -->

## Prerequisities

- JDK, version 11 or later upto JDK 22
- Ant, latest version
- Maven, latest version
- Node.js, latest LTS (to build VSIX)

## Fetching and building the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/javavscode.git
$ cd javavscode/
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/netbeans.git
$ cd netbeans/
$ git checkout 22
$ cd ..
# the following target requires git executable to be on PATH:
$ ant apply-patches
$ ant build-netbeans
```

## Building VS Code extension

To build the VS Code extension invoke:

```bash
ant build-vscode-ext
```
The resulting extension is then in the `build` directory, with the `.vsix` extension.
The typical file name is `oracle-java-0.1.0.vsix`.

### Building for Development

If you want to develop the extension, use these steps for building instead:

```bash
ant build-lsp-server
```

This target is faster than building the `.vsix` file. Find the instructions
for running and debugging below.

### Cleaning

Often it is also important to properly clean everything. Use:

```bash
ant clean-vscode-ext
cd netbeans/
netbeans$ ant clean
```

### Testing

The `java.lsp.server` module has classical (as other NetBeans modules) tests.
The most important one is [ServerTest](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.lsp.server/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/lsp/server/protocol/ServerTest.java)
which simulates LSP communication and checks expected replies. In addition to
that there are VS Code integration tests - those launch VS Code with the
VS extension and check behavior of the TypeScript integration code:

```bash
$ ant build-vscode-ext # first and then
$ ant test-vscode-ext
```

In case you are behind a proxy, you may want to run the tests with

```bash
$ npm_config_https_proxy=http://your.proxy.com:port ant test-vscode-ext
```

when executing the tests for the first time. That shall overcome the proxy
and download an instance of `code` to execute the tests with.
